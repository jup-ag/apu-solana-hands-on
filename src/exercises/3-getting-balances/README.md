# Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

## Why?

- RPC is the API to interact with the Solana.
- Use RPC to read token balances, sending transactions, reading transaction status, literally get any data that Solana has.
- The `Connection` object is a way for JavaScript to interact with your RPC.

To get balance: 
`Connection.getBalance(pubkey)` is used to request to get SOL balance of a wallet.
